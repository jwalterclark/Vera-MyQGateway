# DO NOT UPLOAD TO VERA

This is code that is used when running locally (not on a Vera device).  

dkjson.lua - JSON parser that Vera uses
luup.lua - mock luup extensions (log, chdev, etc)
sha2.lua - sha2 implementation used when running locally on Windows since the Linux os command to generate a hash fails.
